== Introduction
This software is a connector between Shotwell (http://yorba.org/shotwell/), an open source photo manager for Gnome,
 and Piwigo (http://www.piwigo.org), a photo gallery software for the web. It allows users of Shotwell to publish their photos
 into their piwigo installation.

# Download and compile the shotwell code from source: http://yorba.org/shotwell/install/
# Checkout the two files of this repository: piwigo.patch and src/PiwigoConnector.vala
# Apply the patch (please note that the patch is based on revision 2331 of the shotwell code): patch -p0 < piwigo.patch
# Copy the PiwigoConnector.vala file to the src directory of the shotwell code
# Recompile the shotwell code using make
